# Drumkit
This is a drumkit project that uses JavaScript to create a virtual drum kit. The user can click on the keys to make them sound.

The drumkit is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The JavaScript code uses the DOM to create the drums and to add event handlers to the drums. The audio files for the drum sounds are stored in a separate folder.
